<p>The ODALA Air & Water - Core application profile specifies how Observations should be described in general. It forms the basis for domain-specific application profiles such as <a href="https://purl.eu/doc/applicationprofile/AirAndWater/Air">ODALA Air & Water - Air Quality</a> and <a href="https://purl.eu/doc/applicationprofile/AirAndWater/Water">ODALA Air & Water - Water Quality</a>.</p>
<p>The profile is based on <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/32574.html">ISO 19156 Observations and Measurements</a> and on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/">OGC/W3C Semantic Sensor Network Ontology</a>.</p>
<p>From Observations and Measurements, the profile adopts the way an Observation should be described: as an activity performed at a particular time and with a particular Result. It is considered very important to clearly indicate which Object is being observed and which characteristic of that Object.</p>
<p>Objects are usually not directly observable, usually one observes a part that is considered representative of the whole. This can be a specific place, eg a measuring station (class SpatialSamplingFeature) or a physical sample taken from the Object (class Specimen), eg a water sample.</p>
<p>According to the nature of the Result of the Observation, different types of Observations are distinguished (Measurement, Count, Classification etc).</p>
<p>Often there is a need to describe not only the SamplingFeature itself but also the way in which it was created. For that reason, we adopted from the Semantic Sensor Ontology the way in which Sampling is described.</p>
<p>Sampling is considered as an activity just like Observation, ie an event performed at a specific time with a specific result. That result is the SamplingFeature.</p>
<p>The SamplingProcedure and Sampler classes additionally allow to describe how and with the help of which tools the SamplingFeature was obtained.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Semantic Sensor Ontology provides the ObservationProcedure and Sensor classes. The latter may be interpreted broadly as the tool with which the Observation is performed.</p>
<p>A Sensor is regarded as a specialization of a System and in this way acquires additional characteristics that allow to indicate what the accuracy or range of the Sensor is, for example.</p>
<p>A System such as a Sensor is mounted on a Platform or more narrowly defined: a Device (which itself is also a System). We use the <a href="https://saref.etsi.org/core/">SAREF Device Model</a> to describe Devices.</p>
<p>The model also includes a class ObservationCollection to aggregate Observations by common attributes such as the observed Object or observation time. This class comes from an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn-ext/">extension to the Semantic Sensor Ontology</a> and we specialized it with Slice, a class from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">W3C Data Cube Vocabulary</a>.</p>
<p>Observations and Measurements also proposes the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html">ISO 19115 Metadata</a> class to further document Observations. We added a number of elements to this class from the <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core Metadata Initiative</a> such as author, description, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, the classes SamplingFeatureComplex and ObservationContext are worth mentioning, respectively a class for grouping SamplingFeatures (eg a measurement grid) and a class to describe associations between Observations (eg because one Observation relies on another).</p>
<p>A <a href="https://purl.eu/ns/air-and-water/core">vocabulary ODALA Air & Water - Core</a> corresponds to this application profile.</p>
